## Significant Dates

### 8/25-26/2018
The Camellia server was created. KonekoKitten has made the server, later passing ownership to Camellia himself. The original suggestions channel was created. The server was *semi-private* at the time. Korean and Japanese announcements/channels are made.

### 8/28-29/2018
Microsoft Excel is the biggest inside joke. Microsoft Office becomes a meme. The server reaches the 1000-member milestone. Camellia teases a track preview for server members.

### 9/3-4-5/2018
Microsoft Excel and Windows 95 are still memes. Emote suggestions and requests are being considered. Microsoft Excel emotes were added and are still on the server today.

### 6/3-4/2019
The original suggestions channel was closed due to low-quality suggestions.

### 7/17/2021
The photography channels were closed due to inactivity.
