## 😎 WE HAVE A COOL DOMAIN 😎


![papertek.github.io is gone](/assets/images/uploads/crabrave.gif "papertek.github.io is gone")


We have finally got a cool 😎 and fancy domain on [camellia.wiki](https://camellia.wiki)! We hope these changes will be easier to share with friends! Expect more work on replacing old papertek.github.io links in Discord and anywhere else.


We also have a [Beta View](https://beta.camellia.wiki) of the site! This is if you want to see new and upcoming changes!


That's about it for now; we hope to do more cool things in the future! :)
