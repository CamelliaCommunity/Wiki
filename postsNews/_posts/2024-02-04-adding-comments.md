## It took some effort

But that effort is worth it with the new commenting system! With the help of <mark>@codertek</mark> and <mark>@flustix</mark>, a commenting system is now in place. With this new commenting system, we have added some important documentation you must remember. We have added a [Terms of Service](<{% link postsInclude/_posts/legal/2024-01-27-terms-of-service.md %}>) and [Privacy Policy](<{% link postsInclude/_posts/legal/2024-01-27-privacy-policy.md %}>) for the site because we *need* to, it's legal mumbo jumbo, tbh. We also argued about a button in the designs for a good 20 minutes.

![Left button is old, right button is new](/assets/images/uploads/buttonsstuff.png "Left button is old, right button is new")

There are still a few incomplete features that haven't been implemented, such as:

* Proper Mobile Layout
* Upvotes and Downvotes
* Nested Replies

We hope you understand.

Enjoy the commenting system we implemented! If you have any questions *don't hesitate to leave a reply to this article*. :)
