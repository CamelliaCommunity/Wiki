      <h2>Who is Zamboli?</h2>
      <p>
        Zamboli is a house cat that lives with me. He is orange and very smart.
        He may as well be the vice president one day, similar to the popular
        internet cat named Oscar.
      </p>
      <h2>Why is Zamboli special?</h2>
      <p>
        Zamboli has gone through a lot, he managed to beat Feline Infectious
        Peritonitis (FIP). It's known as an "untreatable" virus that we managed
        to treat. Well done Zam!
