        <h2>Who is Zamboli?</h2>
        <p>
          Zamboli is a house cat that lives with me. He is orange and very smart. He may as well be the vice president one day, similar to
          the popular internet cat named Oscar. I will miss him immensely.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is Zamboli special?</h2>
        <p>
          Zamboli has gone through a lot. At one point, he managed to beat Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP). It's known as an
          "untreatable" virus that we managed to treat for a long period of time. Well done Zam!
