## Preamble

> Go to the [Staff Guidelines](/staffGuidelines.html).

We, the people of the Camellia Discord, come together and bond to create a better, easy-to-understand document of regulations and rules. Organized to promote equality, inclusivity and secure the Camellia Discord from any threat, inside and out. Her sovereignty is based on the right of Camellia himself and the janitors, whos weight keeps pressing harder (Staff Members). Together, the team will control the server and push out punishment and rewards for people of the server.

Thank you to some bar in Yugostan for giving me "inspiration" to create this document!

## Part 1: Hierarchy

The server's hierarchy is broken into six major roles;

**Camellia** - Camellia

**Admins** - J6papertek, dwqt (David), Nicocchi, thecodingguy (Matt)

**Elder Mods** - seddywolf (cedric), flustix (scissortek)

**Moderators** - avidmusicenjoyer, gridgalaxy (Casey), manutoad (shar), piavamusic (piquatek), exalvus (rocktek)

**Helpers** - burst06, foundbread, h.i.p.e, jiminp, moonthedarkwolf (lunartek), optelate, naska_link, hypertone, toxism

**People's Roles** - (Member, Verified, Waffle/Pancake Leader, Level Roles, Nitro Boosters, Ko-Fi Donator)

### Definitions

**Camellia** - As Camellia is busy with other duties such as making music and eating chicken, he is mostly hands off with daily operations. He leaves daily operations at the responsibility of the staff team. His role has unlimited power, he is god.

**Admin** - Members of this role are expected to organize and lead the server, uphold this constitution and the staff guidelines, and use force if necessary to keep peace within all the servers (by force, we mean warnings, mutes, kicks, and bans). They also manage the staff team and provide staff members with quality reports if necessary. These quality reports include direct messaging a staff member with a bot and providing information on any disciplinary action or concern.

**Elder Mod** - This role is given to trusted Moderators who have been part of the staff team for a long time. As veterans, they have the opportunity to work closer with Admins (as well as be committed and set an example for all Moderators). They also honor this document and the guidelines that are being enforced within the staff team.

**Moderator** - People with this role have expanded permissions over Helper and have been on the staff team for longer. Their responsibility is expanded to handle decision-making with cases and quality assurance of feedback, discussion, and server shenanigans.

**Helper** - This role applies to *all* of the staff team. Members of this role are expected to enforce this document and the server rules. They will use force if necessary to keep peace within all the server (by force, we mean using warnings, mutes, kicks, and bans). *"Staff Members are expected to honor \[these\] rules as well and arenâ€™t above them, but only slightly under them (less under than you, dear reader)!"* Staff Members will interpret these rules on a case-by-case basis and will discuss internally the actions that must be taken for each case. Do not undermine Staff Members; their decisions are not up for public debate. For concerns regarding decisions, open an Admin Ticket in the ticket channel or contact.

**People's Roles** - These roles are divided into several, each with a certain permission or niche. Of course, not all roles are documented here, but these are the most important ones, as they have their own permissions and expectations.

**Member** - People will only recieve this role ten minutes upon joining the server. This role grants the permission to embed links as well as post images in all of the main channels.

**Verified** - This role is exclusive to people who are widely known in other communities. It is purely cosmetic and adds little value, but it displays which members are speaking.

**Waffle/Pancake Leader** - This role is given to members participating in the server elections. They act as leaders for their party and manage propaganda and protests, keeping their party relevant in the election process. If one of these leaders becomes the president in an election cycle, they may modify server-side items with staff permission.

**Level Roles** - These are roles given to members for every time they level up. They allow access for more features to the server such as thread creation and [#serious-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1080971258272948265).

**Nitro Boosters** - This role is exclusive to members who choose to boost the server. Nitro Boosters have permission to create threads and embed content in more areas.

**Ko-Fi Donator** - With all of its perks, this role is similar to Nitro Boosters, but the user will also have access to soundboard usage and free colored album roles, as well as a private channel.

## Part 2: Rules for the Server

### The Eight Rules

#### **1.** Elitism/toxicity is not allowed (don't be a dick)

- This server is going to have a mixture of communities from all over the place (SDVX, IIDX, osu!, GD, etc.). Saying stuff like "osu! is a garbage game IIDX is better" will get you warned. We do not need this kind of elitism on this server. Everyone is equal. Harassment with malicious intent will not be tolerated.
- We don't allow mini-modding. A helpful hand is always okay but do not try to handle staff-related situations yourself!

#### **2.** Hate speech, hateful acts, and excessive harassment, are not welcomed

- Racism, homophobia, and bigotry fall within discrimination/harassment and are not allowed in any content posted.
- Loopholes around slur usage, such as nibba, etc.; is not welcomed. Other terms/memes to attack groups are not permitted as well.
- For raids, we will report any accounts involved directly to Discord. For witch hunting, all associated members involved will be banned from this server and possibly banned from neighboring servers.

#### **3.** NSFW/NSFL content is not allowed (porn, gore, etc.)

- This server does not need an 18+ channel for the sake of having one.
- Please consult a staff member if you have questions about whether something is allowed.

#### **4.** Use channels correctly and keep discussion in English

- Sensitive or controversial topics such as religion, politics, and mental triggers belong in [#serious-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1080971258272948265) (accessible to level 10 users and up).
- The majority of the people here speak English. If you want to speak another language, locate the correct language channels.

#### **5.** No spamming or advertising

- For spam, this includes ALL spam. (Text spam, Soundboard spam, Mic spam, etc.)
- Advertising includes DMs and other Discords. If you would like to advertise your original work, please locate the correct channels. For music, read [#production-rules](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1038693772260802612).
- Posting your AutoMod punishments is also not allowed.

#### **6.** Avoid unhinged/obsessive discussions about artists or celebrities

- Please be respectful when talking about artists and celebrities. They're humans, too! Impersonation is also not allowed. Doing this will result in a ban.
- This includes pinging Camellia or any verified members without reason. Pinging them excessively/obnoxiously in an attempt to get their attention will result in punishment.
- Do not insert Camellia's (real) face in your avatar (per his request; please respect it).

#### **7.** AI "art" is not allowed

- Posting AI "art" will result in deletion. Continuous infractions will result in warnings!
- It is also discouraged to post any AI content in general unless you're really clever with humor.

#### **8.** No discussion of KONAMI warez/piracy

- This includes Bemani games, albums and soforth.
- Distribution of pirated content is also not allowed.*

> These rules are subject to change but not up for public discussion, unless brought up solely in the server direction channel.
{: .disclaimer }

We expect members to respect each other and the staff team. We also have minors in the community, so sexual discussions and degeneracy should be kept to a minimum. Remember to follow [Discord's TOS](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). The higher your role is (including levels), the more we expect from you. If a rule is broken, we ask you to act on it and notify the staff team instead of escalating.

## Part 3: Expectation of Conduct from Staff Members

The staff team's role is to uphold the server rules and keep peace within the server. Helpers can mute, kick, and warn members to achieve this goal. Moderators and up have full powers to mute, kick, ban, and warn and will utilize these permissions as needed. Staff members must also follow the [Staff Guidelines](/staffGuidelines.html). *All* staff members will be biased towards some members because this is part of being in a community. However, bias will be ignored once we discuss actions necessary to uphold this constitution. A staff member's decision is final and can only be overturned by appealing or submitting an Admin Ticket for in-depth discussion.

## Part 4: Communicating with the Discord Mod

Pinging staff members individually or as a group is allowed. However, if a staff member states in their profile or in the chat not to direct message or tag them, their request must be respected.

Direct messaging between members and staff should be kept to a minimum and always respectful. If you are being harassed through DMs, please contact us (the staff team).

If you see someone breaking the rules, being a nuisance, or being weird, don't be afraid to tag us. Messages get to us quicker if you open a ticket in [#ticket-creation](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1037187523677524038)!

Direct messaging Camellia is strongly discouraged as he is a very busy person. Message him with caution as his own words say: "In the worst case I would block you without any warning". Please review the rest of this Wiki for questions you may have regarding Camellia.

## Part 5: Banishment system

With each case given to us, we must follow the [Staff Guidelines'](/staffGuidelines.html) way of handling most situations. For bans, moderators may discuss internally but they aren't obligated to.

Some transgressions against the Rules will result in a ban, some may experience a kick or a mute, and we will generally not divulge details about moderator actions unless an Admin grants permission (or an Admin willingly shares this information).

If you wish to be unbanned from Discord, do not visit any of the staff team's social media or unnecessarily stalk them. Wick's ban appeal system is there for a reason!

Ban evading or aiding a ban will also be met with a ban without warning.
