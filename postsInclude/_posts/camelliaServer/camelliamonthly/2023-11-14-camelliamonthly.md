### New Releases

**Chocolat Cadabra („Ç∑„Éß„Ç≥„É©„Ç´„Çø„Éñ„É©):** LOTTE's chocolate celebrates its 60th anniversary! What better way to commemorate than by creating a one of a kind, [banger joint song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5j7lpWprro) between Ado (singer), Taku Inoue (composer), and Camellia (lyricist) for a Studio Trigger MV?

### Server Events

**Server Elections:** It's that time again for breakfast elections - waffles vs. pancakes! Show some love to your favorite breakfast item by voting for your preferred team [here](https://strawpoll.com/w4nWr6Q8YyA)! Feel free to share the poll around and garner support. There are still 9 days left to cast your vote!

### Server Updates

**New Staff:** Let's welcome in our newly-promoted Temp-Admin <mark>@thecodingguy</mark> and Helper <mark>@hypertone</mark>

**Current State of the Camellia Wiki:** The Camellia Wiki has seen some new updates and bug fixes! We've been hard at work with our newest feature, "Comments!" You can seek a preview on our [Beta View](https://beta.camellia.wiki) of the wiki! This will eventually be merged into the [main live branch](https://github.com/CamelliaCommunity/Wiki/live). See something missing? Read our [contributing article](https://camellia.wiki/contributing) to get started!

**Archival of News and Releases JP:** We've decided to merge the EN and JP news as a means of consolidating all the information into a single channel. Now, it looks more concise!

**Return of Suggestion Forums:** Missed the suggestion forums? Did we not see your suggestion? Not to worry! Now, with the [‚Å†#üí°suggestion-forums](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1046122599064817765) back, no suggestions will be missed!

**AI "Art" Restrictions:** AI-generated artwork will no longer be allowed in art channels. Why? We feel that it brings a level of "cheating" when artists spend years refining their art, whereas AI can do it in just seconds, primarily by using said artists' work for reference without authorization. While AI artwork is not allowed in the art channels, the rest of the server should not be affected. Still, we strongly discourage the use of AI content. 

## December 2023

With 2023 finally ending, let's take a moment to think about all that's gone on this year... For now, though, let's review what happened in the last month of the year: December!

![December 2023 Monthly Logo](/assets/images/camellia/server/monthly/2023-december.png)

### We're back to the canvas again, with more Camellia to be drawn

After all the spooky and birthday spirit shown in everyone's drawings back in the previous drawing contest, we've put you all to the test of Christmas spirit by providing some festive and jolly entries for the [winter drawing event!](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1123866069438840883/1184616225066725416) You still have until January 10th to submit a drawing, so time is still available to make a masterpiece!

### TANO\*C TOUR 2024

It has recently been revealed that Camellia will play at the TANO\*C TOUR 2024 live event this year, taking place at the EX Theater Roppongi in Tokyo on June 8th!

### Server Stuff

#### Mimu's Shop Revamp

While introducing the new economy and brand new shop with release roles was great, there was room for improvement. Throughout a couple of weeks, with the help of you guys providing feedback on tons of new additions to the shop and reworks regarding the shop's pricing, we were able to completely rehaul everything our shopkeeper, Mimu, had to provide when it first started selling to you guys! (Thanks to <mark>@H.I.P.E</mark> for their work on role icons and everyone who contributed in [#üí°server-direction](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1034240760154947584))!

#### A Shifting Staff Team

The past month or two have seen a few significant changes in the staff team, including the arrival (and departure) of some friends over at the Nanahira server, as well as the resignation of Chai, who was a major contributor to past editions of this very article you‚Äôre reading. Although we have seen many friends join and leave our ranks, rest assured that those of us here will continue to do our best to ensure this server is a place you all will enjoy being in.

#### For 2024, we‚Äôre also applying a ton of different things! Including

1. Enforcing the new Staff Guidelines
1. Removing <mark>@Challenges Judge</mark>, <mark>@Minecraft Helper</mark> and, <mark>@Event Organizer</mark> in favor of <mark>@Community Contributor</mark> (this update is still not immediate because we have <mark>@Toxism</mark> still relying on <mark>@Challenges Judge</mark> for now).
1. Implementing [Ko-fi community funding](https://ko-fi.com/camelliacommunity).
1. <mark>@papertek</mark> "Pinging everyone is nono, only for Camellia Monthly" Pinging everyone is nono, only for Camellia monthly & genuinely Crucial situations/problems that affect the server*

And more to come. :)

#### P.S

If you want a piece of the action, [staff applications](https://forms.gle/Abfe4di62m1cHUWh8) are still open! We‚Äôd love to see you on board, so feel free to check it out if you‚Äôd like.

Thank you all for a great 2023, let's work together to have even more fun in 2024!

## October 2023

With the success of the first edition, this time, we‚Äôve asked you all to provide some birthday and spooky entries to this version!

### Song Releases - October

[Hou { Phoenix }](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/ddr/ddra3/p/): Camellia didn‚Äôt seem satisfied breaking our hands‚Ä¶ so now he‚Äôs targeting our legs... The man has created a monster of a track in DDR A3‚Äôs ‚ÄúBabylon‚Äôs Galaxy‚Äù event as the ONE MORE EXTRA STAGE! Good luck to all those dancers; don‚Äôt break too many legs!

[i - ii](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/2dx/31/): What‚Äôs an IIDX game without Camellia in it? Bringing in his banger hi-tech psy style, get those DJ hands ready for some Metro Techno action with this unlockable song!

### New Staff Members

Some of you might notice that three new admins have joined us - <mark>@azunyan0007, @ungrave, and @nicocchi_,</mark> have come over from the Nanahira community to offer help! Feel free to welcome them if you see them interacting in general chat. With them helping out, our admin team now forms a cool heptagon (probably a more relaxed shape than a square?). We‚Äôre grateful they‚Äôll be volunteering their time to help all of us out, and we look forward to working with them!

### Staff and Rules Updates

We have cut down *many* rules and combined some to make things more sane for new and existing members (from 17 down to 7!). We also added some clarification on current disclaimers as well as old ones. Please give them a read: [#üßærules-and-info](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1121280346638524456). In parallel, we have also updated the Staff Guidelines again, adding an entirely [new section](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1088625892105924648/1164858060578230326) to it. An autobiography/transparency document was also [uploaded by papertek](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1088625892105924648/1167233462927904858), documenting his time in the community. Lastly, server moderation systems have switched off from Dyno to Wick. The full announcement is [here](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1088625892105924648/1169401636754563145). With these changes and updates, we hope you enjoy your time in the server even more~

### Chinese Thread

After some pestering from server members, we‚Äôve created the new [Chinese thread](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1168752239561678868/1168752239561678868). CamelliaÁöÑË°åÊîø‰∫∫ÂëòÈÉΩÊÉ≥ËÆ©ÊàëÂÜô‰∏Ä‰∏™Â•ΩÁ¨ëÁöÑ‰ø°ÊÅØÔºåÂõ†Ê≠§ÊàëÁé∞Âú®ÊÉ≥ËØ¥‰ªñ‰ª¨ÈÉΩÊòØÊúâÁâπÂà´ÊØõÁóÖÁöÑ‰∫∫-

### Aesthetic Changes

It‚Äôs time to spice things up with new-level role names and colors! We hope this will bring a fresh new look to parts of the server. We also took the time to add some icons to the side of channels and change up the welcome message in [#üëãhello-there](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1033585407285272596). As always, we welcome your suggestions on these changes in [#üí°server-direction](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1034240760154947584). We hope you enjoy the improvement! Cheers to next month~
